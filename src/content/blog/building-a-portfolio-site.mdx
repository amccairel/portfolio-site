# building a portfolio site

## introduction

### intent and vision for portfolio site

i created this portfolio site, specifically the blog section, to share discourse on software engineering topics
and discuss projects i'm working on - or previously worked on. i'm a regular engineer trying to earn
my chili, make some meaning, and enjoy this ride. if you're on a similar path - welcome!

let's get started, shall we? what frameworks and libraries were used. how is it hosted, and so on...

## Next.js

### *the* framework. jk, one of many React frameworks.

even one of many web frameworks, like [Angular](https://angular.dev) or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). why **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)** and a [React](https://react.dev)
framework? i'll tell you why. it would make little sense to be writing this, otherwise, would it.

first, i chose Next.js because i simply wanted to learn a React framework. my industry experience has been in other
frameworks for full-stack web development — like Angular and Vue.js. why not use this as an opportunity to learn something
different!

the second reason can be deemed more interesting. you can serve a production Next.js application a few different
ways. you can statically serve the app using a static site generator (SSG). or you could server side render components
and send them to the client. even further, you could serve a full-stack Next.js application, backend and frontend all
in one.

you might wonder, "isn't this framework a little overpowered for a simple blog?" i completely agree. it **is** overboard.
however, the static site generation is appealing here. i'd like to easily publish content and a SSG is well suited for
that purpose.

last, if i ever want to evolve from just a static blog, those options are still on the table with Next.js. you want to
take it full-stack with a contact form, interactive project demos, and some REST apis for visitors to sample? those
features are available.

## useful libraries and frameworks

### because building everything from scratch is unreasonable.

for styling throughout the portfolio site, i used [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com). great experience with the
CSS framework. very intuitive to use. it can feel a little clustered with all the tailwindcss utility classes in your
markdown. with some effort, I’m sure I could clean that up — but for a small, simply styled app, it’s fine.
i'm not a frontend developer. in addition, [@tailwindcss/typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) is a plugin to style your blog prose uniformly
and easily.

creating the blog content was easy. write your content as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), a superset of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which is a markup
language for formatting text. when writing long posts with lots of links, headers, emphasis, and so on, it can be easier
than writing HTML.

recall that Next.js does not support MDX out-of-the-box. how do we convert the content from our MDX files into usable
React components? on top of that, is it possible to dynamically visit posts, or does a page per
MDX file need to be made? well...this part ended up not being trivial. luckily, Next.js offers excellent
[documentation on integrating MDX](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/mdx) into your application.

the steps are as follows:

1. set up the necessary configuration to import and render MDX files in your route structure
2. read the file, if you have frontmatter, parse it. i liked the [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) plugin.

```
import matter from 'gray-matter'

function parseMetaData(rawContent: string) {
    const { data } =  matter(rawContent)

    return { meta: data }
}

function parseContent(rawContent: string) {
    const { content } = matter(rawContent)

    return { content }
}
```

3. convert the markdown to a usable React component

```
import path from 'path'
import { evaluate } from '@mdx-js/mdx'
import * as runtime from 'react/jsx-runtime'

export async function getPost(slug: string) {
    const filePath: string = path.join(POSTS_PATH, `${slug}.mdx`)
    const rawContent: string = readMDXFile(filePath)
    const { content } = parseContent(rawContent)

    const { default: Post } = await evaluate(content, {
        ...runtime // Provides JSX transformation for MDX
    })

    return { Post }
}
```

the `runtime` object contains the React JSX runtime, which provides the necessary functions for MDX to compile your
markdown content into executable React components. this is imported from React's built-in JSX runtime.

4. display the component on your desired page

```
import { getPost } from '@/lib/mdx'

export default async function Page({ params } : { params: Promise<{ slug: string}> }) {
    const { slug } = await params
    const { Post } = await getPost(slug)

    return (
        <MdxLayout>
            <Post />
        </MdxLayout>
    )
}
```


## deploying

### sometimes the simple option is the best option.

there are a number of ways to deploy a Next.js application. Netlify. AWS. if you want to get technical with it, you
could containerize the application with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and self-host. that's a great feature of Next.js — it's
flexible about hosting options.

out of simplicity, i went with [Vercel](https://vercel.com). they created Next.js, have a generous free tier, excellent developer
experience with automatic deployments from Git, built-in analytics, and seamless handling of all Next.js features.
this allows one to focus on content and future projects, instead of infrastructure.

## conclusion

### a fun framework.

thank you for taking the time to read. i enjoyed explaining Next.js and why i chose it as a framework for building my
portfolio site. i hope it helps anyone building a similar application. it's a great React framework with plenty of
community support for your web application needs. it's more than just a static site generator. it can support full-stack
capabilities. this makes it a respectable choice for a software engineer like myself, who may want to add more advanced
features down the line. cheers, thanks for joining me on the deep dive!
