# My Opinions don't matter but here they are...

## My goodness you haven't left yet?

### Ah geez. I guess you are persistent.

I created this portfolio site, and specifically the blog section to share discourse on software engineering topics
and discuss projects I am working on in real time. I'm just an average dude making his way in America, trying to earn
his chili. There's nothing special about me, I'm no genius coder. If you feel like following along, great! But I'm sure
there are plenty of folks out there more creative and clever than I. 'Tis just a humble learners opinion. Read at your
own peril!
